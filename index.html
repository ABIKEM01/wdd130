      <p>
        My name is Abiodun Temitope Babayode. I'm a Nigerian software engineer
        with a passion for building digital solutions that make life easier and
        more secure. Over the years, I've worked in various roles across the
        tech industry. I've developed secure systems, built backend services,
        and contributed to platforms both locally and internationally. My
        experience spans across organizations like ITSkills Center, Techconnfer
        Technology in India, Eagle3D Streaming, Norlics Technology, and
        currently Enexgi Technology where I work as a security software
        developer. At Norlics, I help build and maintain a platform that manages
        revenue and tax collection for the Enugu State Government. My core stack
        includes Node.js, Express, MySQL, MongoDB, and Sequelize, among other
        tools. Beyond work, I'm a family man—happily married with two children.
        I'm a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and my
        faith plays a big role in my life. I'm also currently furthering my
        education in software development through BYU–Idaho's Pathway Connect
        program.

      <p>
        Nigeria, an African country on the Gulf of Guinea, has many natural
        landmarks and wildlife reserves. Protected areas such as Cross River
        National Park and Yankari National Park have waterfalls, dense
        rainforest, savanna and rare primate habitats. One of the most
        recognizable sites is Zuma Rock, a 725m-tall monolith outside the
        capital of Abuja that's pictured on the national currency.
